## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a phd student at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona Tech. 
My research interests are InSAR Geomatics/Remote Sensing/Computer Vision.
Specifically, I'm focused on SAR image registration, MT-InSAR deformation monitoring, and points cloud fusion using deep learning technology.
If you have the same research interest as me, we can talk about more details about these. ðŸ˜€
Many thanks for your attention!
